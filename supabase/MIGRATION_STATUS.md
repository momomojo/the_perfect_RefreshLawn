## Verification Resources

1. **Verification Guide:**

   - See `supabase/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step instructions on verifying your migrations

2. **SQL Verification Script:**
   - Use `supabase/verify-migrations.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor to check your database setup

## Required Manual Actions

⚠️ **Important:** The following steps must be completed manually in the Supabase dashboard:

1. **Enable JWT Hook:**
   - Navigate to Authentication > Hooks in the Supabase dashboard
   - Enable the Custom JWT hook
   - Select the `custom_access_token_hook` function
   - Save the settings

## Future Edge Function Deployment

To deploy the verification edge function in the future (requires Docker Desktop running):

1. Start Docker Desktop
2. Run: `supabase functions deploy verify-migration`
3. Access the function at: `https://brvgbflmcolgvswuzjho.supabase.co/functions/v1/verify-migration`

## Next Steps for Your Project

1. Complete the manual verification using the provided SQL script and guide
2. Start building your application features that rely on the database schema
3. Test the JWT claims functionality with different user roles
4. Implement frontend role-based access control using the JWT claims

## Migration Notes

- If you need to make future schema changes, create new migration files with the format: `YYYYMMDD_description.sql`
- Use `supabase db push` to apply new migrations
- Keep track of all migrations for future reference
