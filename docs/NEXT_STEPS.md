# RefreshLawn Project: Next Steps

After completing the authentication system implementation, here's what we should focus on next.

## Completed So Far

âœ… **Authentication System**

- User signup, signin, and password reset functionality
- JWT-based role system with custom access token hook
- Role storage in `user_roles` table and `profiles` table
- Row Level Security policies for all tables
- Role consistency checking and repair functions
- Comprehensive testing scripts

## Next Steps

Based on the project documentation and current state, these are the priority areas to focus on next:

### 1. Booking System Implementation

The core functionality of the RefreshLawn app is the booking system. We should focus on:

- **Service Selection UI**: Allow customers to browse and select lawn care services
- **Scheduling Calendar**: Implement a date and time picker for service scheduling
- **Booking Management**: Create screens for viewing, editing, and canceling bookings
- **Technician Assignment**: Build the system for assigning technicians to bookings

### 2. Stripe Payment Integration

As outlined in the tech stack, we need to implement payments with Stripe:

- **Payment Method Setup**: Allow customers to add and manage payment methods
- **Checkout Flow**: Create a seamless checkout process for bookings
- **Recurring Payments**: Implement subscription handling for recurring services
- **Technician Payouts**: Set up the system for paying service providers

### 3. Mobile App UI/UX Enhancement

With the backend authentication in place, we should focus on improving the mobile experience:

- **User Onboarding**: Create a smooth first-time user experience
- **Profile Management**: Allow users to update their information and preferences
- **Service Dashboard**: Build a home screen showing upcoming bookings and available services
- **Notifications**: Implement push notifications for booking reminders and updates

### 4. Testing Strategy Implementation

Following our testing strategy document:

- **Unit Tests**: Implement Jest tests for business logic and API calls
- **E2E Tests**: Set up Detox for UI testing of critical user flows
- **API Tests**: Create tests for Supabase Edge Functions and Stripe integration
- **CI/CD Integration**: Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing

### 5. Admin Dashboard

For business operations, we need to build an admin interface:

- **User Management**: Ability to view, edit, and manage user accounts
- **Service Management**: Interface for adding/editing service offerings and pricing
- **Booking Overview**: Comprehensive view of all bookings and their status
- **Analytics**: Basic reporting on bookings, revenue, and technician performance

## Implementation Priority

1. **Booking System** - This is the core functionality and should be prioritized first
2. **Stripe Integration** - Essential for monetization and can be developed in parallel
3. **UI/UX Enhancements** - Important for user experience but can be refined iteratively
4. **Testing Implementation** - Should be done alongside feature development
5. **Admin Dashboard** - Important for operations but can come after core user features

## Technical Debt to Address

- Update Supabase CLI (noticed it's on v2.15.8 while v2.19.7 is available)
- Consider simplifying the role management system to reduce complexity
- Organize and document Edge Functions as they are developed
