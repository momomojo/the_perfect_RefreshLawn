# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Database Management

This project includes tools for easy database backup and restoration. For more information, see:

- [Database Backup Documentation](./database-backup/README.md) - Detailed instructions for backing up and restoring your Supabase database
- [Quick Start Guide](./database-backup/QUICK_START.md) - Simple step-by-step guide for beginners

To create a database backup:
```bash
# For Mac/Linux
cd database-backup
chmod +x backup.sh
./backup.sh

# For Windows
cd database-backup
backup.bat
```

To restore a database from backup:
```bash
# For Mac/Linux
cd database-backup
chmod +x restore.sh
./restore.sh

# For Windows
cd database-backup
restore.bat
```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
